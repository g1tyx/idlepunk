**Patch 0.2.** 

-Your data stays at the top of the screen as you scroll down.  
-Added lots more number sizes (up to 10^150 (which is called novemquadragintillion (which is an awesome name for a number))).  
-You can now import & export saves.  
-Autobuying numbers are now pretty.  
-That bug where everything jumps up and down is now fixed.  
-Upgrades now say exactly what they do.  
-Total data hacked is no longer displayed, I'll probably add this back in another spot in the future.  
-Game should look better on high res monitors.  
-Game should look better on Firefox.  
-I turned on spell check in Sublime.  
-A message is now displayed when the game fails to load (sorry IE & Safari but it's not meant to be).  
-Some other bug fixes.
